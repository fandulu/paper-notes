Abstract

'We introduce associative embedding, a novel method for
supervising convolutional neural networks for the task of
detection and grouping. A number of computer vision problems
can be framed in this manner including multi-person
pose estimation, instance segmentation, and multi-object
tracking. Usually the grouping of detections is achieved with
multi-stage pipelines, instead we propose an approach that
teaches a network to simultaneously output detections and
group assignments...'
