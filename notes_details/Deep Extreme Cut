Abstract: This paper explores the use of extreme points in an object
(left-most, right-most, top, bottom pixels) as input to obtain
precise object segmentation for images and videos. We do
so by adding an extra channel to the image in the input of
a convolutional neural network (CNN), which contains a
Gaussian centered in each of the extreme points. The CNN
learns to transform this information into a segmentation of
an object that matches those extreme points.
