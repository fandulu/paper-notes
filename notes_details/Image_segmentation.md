1. First-order proximity (quiry and gallary) 
2. Meta-second-order proximity (quiry-train and gallary-train)

The converntional second-order proximity: is the similarity between their neighborhood within quiry or gallary itself (e.g., self-diffusion)
Ours: is the similarity between their neighborhood within training set (meta) 

How to intergrate First-order and Meta-second-order proximity? cross-diffisuion
